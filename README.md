# Calculator-Project-Team-1
Hi Team 1! 
<br/><br/>
In this task you and your team are required to build a basic calculator app.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Is not essential that you use any framework to fulfil the task but, this could be a good exercise to practice your bootstrap skills, if you wish to.  
<br/>
You'll work as a team and each team member should work on a different operation (as a suggestion).
<br/><br/>
Ex: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc.
<br/><br/>
For start, please add your name to this list:
<br/><br/>
Jorge, Gyorgy, Benjamin
